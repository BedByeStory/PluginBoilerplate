# Plugin Deployment

## Get Started

```
$ npm run build
```

If successful this will output an index.js script in the /build directory.

## Approval

Deployment of community plugins to [BedByeStoryÂ©](https://bedbyestory.com) is still a manual process. Automated tooling is being developed as needed. If you would like to deploy your interaction pleae send a git repo or contact me at [rphansen91@gmail.com](mailto:rphansen91@gmail.com).
